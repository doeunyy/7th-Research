- **Key Focus**: This paper addresses the challenge of image interpolation, which is underexplored in current image generation pipelines. The authors propose a novel method using latent diffusion models to perform zero-shot interpolation between two input images. Their approach combines latent space interpolation with noise scheduling, textual inversion, and pose conditioning for diverse styles, layouts, and subjects. The paper also highlights limitations in existing metrics like FID for evaluating interpolation quality
